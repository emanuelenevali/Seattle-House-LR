# STAT PROJECT

The project, carried out with R, consists in creating a linear regression model based on the choice of some significant covariates. The dataset in question was chosen on Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction ). The goal was to predict the price of homes in the Seattle, USA area, and after an analysis of the data we obtained a price forecast subject to an error of about 8-10%

Code:  
Function.R is basically a script dedicated to the helpers function used during the actual analysis  
MAIN_Seattle.R is about the first part of the project where we predict the price of homes in Seattle city  
MAIN_noOLD.R is a deeper analysis of neighboring counties as well in which we did not consider old houses infact most of the times those were outliers
